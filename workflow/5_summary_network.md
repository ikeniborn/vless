# Work Summary - Docker Network Overlap Fix

## Issue Fixed
Docker Compose failed to start with error: "Pool overlaps with other one on this address space" when creating vless-reality_vless-network.

## Root Cause
- Hardcoded subnet (172.30.0.0/16) in docker-compose.yml.tpl
- Network already existed from previous installation
- IP range conflicted with existing Docker networks

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Hardcoded IP Configuration
- **File:** `templates/docker-compose.yml.tpl`
- **Change:** Removed `ipam` section with fixed subnet
- **Result:** Docker now auto-selects available IP range

### 2. Added Network Cleanup Function
- **File:** `scripts/lib/utils.sh`
- **Function:** `cleanup_existing_network()`
- **Purpose:** Remove existing network before creating new one

### 3. Added Network Diagnostics
- **File:** `scripts/lib/utils.sh`
- **Function:** `check_docker_networks()`
- **Purpose:** Warn about network configuration issues

### 4. Modified Installation Flow
- **File:** `scripts/install.sh`
- **Change:** Call cleanup before starting service
- **Result:** Prevents network conflicts during installation

## Files Modified
- `templates/docker-compose.yml.tpl` (removed subnet configuration)
- `scripts/lib/utils.sh` (added network management functions)
- `scripts/install.sh` (added network cleanup call)

## New Behavior
- **Before:** Fixed IP range → Conflicts → Installation fails
- **After:** Dynamic IP → Cleanup existing → Auto-select free range → Success

## Benefits
✅ No more network overlap errors
✅ Works with many Docker networks
✅ Automatic conflict resolution
✅ Better cross-system compatibility
✅ Clear user feedback

## Testing Status
✅ Syntax validation passed
✅ Docker Compose template valid
✅ Logic verification complete
✅ Edge cases handled

## User Impact
Users can now:
- Install on systems with many Docker networks
- Re-install without manual network cleanup
- Avoid IP range conflicts automatically

## Next Steps
Ready for testing in real environment. The fix should resolve the installation error completely.

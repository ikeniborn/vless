            The sed command in apply_template function is throwing "unterminated `s' command" error
            during Xray configuration creation in the install.sh script.
        </problem>
        <root_cause>
            Complex sed expressions with semicolons can cause parsing issues in some environments.
            The error occurs at character 78 in the sed expression.
        </root_cause>
        <current_state>
            The fix appears to be already implemented in lib/config.sh:167, where the sed command
            is split into separate piped commands to avoid parsing issues.
        </current_state>

# Phase 3: Implementation Report

## Completed Changes

### 1. Docker Compose Template (templates/docker-compose.yml.tpl)
**Changes Made:**
- Removed `ports` mapping (lines 6-7) - not needed with host network mode
- Added `network_mode: host` (line 6) to the xray-server service
- Removed `networks` section (lines 14-16 and 23-25) - not needed with host mode
- Kept healthcheck configuration unchanged as it works with host network

**Result:** Container now uses host network directly, bypassing Docker's bridge network NAT issues.

### 2. UFW Firewall Functions (scripts/lib/utils.sh)
**Added Functions:**
- `check_ufw_status()` - Checks if UFW is installed and active
- `ensure_ufw_rule()` - Adds UFW allow rule for specified port if not exists
- `configure_firewall_for_vless()` - Main function to configure firewall for VLESS service

**Features:**
- Gracefully handles UFW not installed, inactive, or active states
- Checks for existing rules before adding to avoid duplicates
- Falls back to iptables check if UFW not available
- Adds rules with descriptive comment "VLESS VPN Service"

### 3. Installation Script (scripts/install.sh)
**Changes Made:**
- Added firewall configuration call after port validation (line 125)
- Removed SERVER_PORT parameter from docker-compose template application (line 301)
- Firewall configuration happens during initial setup phase

**Result:** Installation now properly configures firewall rules for the service port.

### 4. Other Scripts Assessment
**No Changes Required:**
- `restart_xray_service()` in lib/config.sh - Works correctly with host network
- `backup.sh` - Uses docker-compose commands that work with any network mode
- `reinstall.sh` - Calls install.sh which has been updated
- `update.sh` - Uses docker-compose commands that work with any network mode
- `logs.sh` - Uses docker-compose logs commands unaffected by network mode

## Implementation Details

### Network Mode Change
The switch from bridge to host network mode means:
- Container directly binds to host's port 443
- No Docker NAT translation needed
- Better performance and fewer routing issues
- Container sees real client IPs directly

### Firewall Integration
The firewall configuration:
1. Checks UFW status first
2. If active, ensures port 443/tcp is allowed
3. If inactive, notifies user but continues
4. If not installed, checks iptables as fallback
5. Always verifies port is actually listening after configuration

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing installations will need to regenerate docker-compose.yml
- No changes to user data or Xray configuration needed
- Service behavior remains the same from user perspective

## Files Modified
1. `/templates/docker-compose.yml.tpl` - Docker compose template
2. `/scripts/lib/utils.sh` - Added UFW utility functions
3. `/scripts/install.sh` - Added firewall configuration

## Testing Requirements
- Test fresh installation with UFW active
- Test fresh installation with UFW inactive
- Test fresh installation without UFW
- Verify port 443 is accessible after installation
- Verify container starts correctly with host network mode

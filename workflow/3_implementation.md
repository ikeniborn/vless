# Implementation Report

## Problem Fixed
Fixed the issue where vless commands (vless-users, vless-logs, vless-backup, vless-update) were showing error "lib/colors.sh: No such file or directory" when run without sudo.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by restrictive permissions (750) on /opt/vless/scripts/ directory and its contents. Regular users couldn't read the script files and libraries, causing the "file not found" error.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created fix-permissions.sh script
- Location: `/home/ikeniborn/Documents/Project/vless/scripts/fix-permissions.sh`
- Purpose: Sets proper permissions according to PRD.md requirements
- Key changes:
  - Scripts directory: 755 (readable by all)
  - Script files: 755 (executable by all)
  - Library files: 644 (readable by all)
  - Sensitive data files remain 600 (root only)

### 2. Updated user-manager.sh
- Removed blanket root check at startup
- Added root check only for write operations (add_user, remove_user)
- Read operations (show_users, export_config) work without sudo

### 3. Updated logs.sh
- Removed blanket root check at startup
- Added root check only for clear_logs function
- Reading and following logs works without sudo

### 4. Updated install.sh and update.sh
- Both scripts now call fix-permissions.sh after installation/update
- Ensures permissions are correctly set for new installations

### 5. Commands behavior after fix

| Command | Read Operations | Write Operations |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| vless-users | No sudo needed | Requires sudo for add/remove |
| vless-logs | No sudo needed | Requires sudo for clear |
| vless-backup | Always requires sudo | Always requires sudo |
| vless-update | Always requires sudo | Always requires sudo |

## Files Modified
1. Created: `scripts/fix-permissions.sh`
2. Modified: `scripts/install.sh`
3. Modified: `scripts/update.sh`
4. Modified: `scripts/user-manager.sh`
5. Modified: `scripts/logs.sh`

## Testing Results
- ✓ vless-users: Lists users without sudo
- ✓ vless-logs: Shows logs without sudo
- ✓ vless-backup: Correctly requires sudo (handles sensitive data)
- ✓ vless-update: Correctly requires sudo (modifies system)

## Security Considerations
- Sensitive files (/opt/vless/data/, config.json, .env) remain protected with 600 permissions
- Only read operations are allowed without sudo
- All write operations still require root privileges
- Follows PRD.md security requirements

## How to Apply Fix

### For existing installations:
```bash
sudo /opt/vless/scripts/fix-permissions.sh
```

### For new installations:
The fix is automatically applied during installation.

### For updates:
The fix is automatically applied during update process.

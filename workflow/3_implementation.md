# Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `scripts/lib/utils.sh`

**Function:** `check_system_requirements()`
**Lines:** 244-259

#### Changes:
1. Changed `print_error` to `print_warning` for disk space notification
2. Modified message from "required" to "recommended" to indicate it's not mandatory
3. Added informative messages about potential issues with low disk space:
   - Docker container storage
   - Log file accumulation
   - Backup creation
4. Added user confirmation prompt using `confirm_action` function
5. Only increment error counter if user chooses to cancel installation
6. Added fallback value `${free_space:-0}` to handle empty variable case

#### Behavior:
- **Before:** Installation automatically stopped with error if disk space < 5GB
- **After:** Installation shows warning and asks user for confirmation to continue

#### User Flow:
1. If disk space < 5GB, user sees warning message
2. User is informed about potential issues
3. User is prompted: "Do you want to continue despite low disk space? [y/N]:"
4. If user answers 'n' or Enter (default): Installation is cancelled
5. If user answers 'y': Installation continues with warning acknowledged

## Files Modified
- `/home/ikeniborn/Documents/Project/vless/scripts/lib/utils.sh`

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test installation with < 5GB available in /opt
2. Test installation with > 5GB available in /opt
3. Test user response 'y' to continue
4. Test user response 'n' to cancel
5. Test default response (Enter key)

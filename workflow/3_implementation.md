# Implementation Summary

## Problem
The sed command in `apply_template` function was throwing "unterminated `s' command" error during Xray configuration creation in the install.sh script on a remote server.

## Root Cause
Complex sed expressions with semicolons were causing parsing issues in certain environments. The original command:
```bash
sed 's/\\/\\\\/g; s/\//\\\//g; s/&/\\&/g'
```

## Solution Applied
The fix has already been implemented in commit `36c6399` on Sep 29, 2025. The solution splits the complex sed command into separate piped commands:

### Before (causing error):
```bash
value=$(echo "$value" | sed 's/\\/\\\\/g; s/\//\\\//g; s/&/\\&/g')
```

### After (fixed):
```bash
value=$(printf '%s' "$value" | sed 's/\\/\\\\/g' | sed 's/\//\\\//g' | sed 's/&/\\&/g')
```

## Key Changes
1. **Split sed commands**: Each substitution is now a separate sed command in the pipeline
2. **Changed echo to printf**: Using `printf '%s'` instead of `echo` for better handling of special characters
3. **Added comments**: Documented the reason for the change in the code

## Files Modified
- `scripts/lib/config.sh` - Line 167: The apply_template function

## Testing Performed
1. Created comprehensive test script: `tests/test_apply_template.sh`
2. Tested with normal values
3. Tested with special characters (/, \, &)
4. Tested with real REALITY configuration values
5. All tests passed successfully

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Test the function directly
source scripts/lib/colors.sh scripts/lib/utils.sh scripts/lib/config.sh
apply_template "templates/config.json.tpl" "/tmp/test.json" \
    "ADMIN_UUID=test-uuid" \
    "REALITY_DEST=speed.cloudflare.com:443"

# Run comprehensive tests
bash tests/test_apply_template.sh
```

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - The issue has been resolved and tested successfully

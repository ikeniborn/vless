# Implementation Report

## Executed Tasks

### 1. Created Missing Symlinks
- Created symlink: `/usr/local/bin/vless-users -> /opt/vless/scripts/user-manager.sh`
- Created symlink: `/usr/local/bin/vless-logs -> /opt/vless/scripts/logs.sh`
- Created symlink: `/usr/local/bin/vless-backup -> /opt/vless/scripts/backup.sh`
- Created symlink: `/usr/local/bin/vless-update -> /opt/vless/scripts/update.sh`

### 2. Created Symlink Repair Tool
**File**: `scripts/fix-symlinks.sh`
- Checks and repairs all VLESS command symlinks
- Verifies target scripts exist
- Handles incorrect symlinks and regular files
- Provides detailed status reporting
- Tests command availability after repair

### 3. Enhanced Install Script
**File**: `scripts/install.sh`
- Improved `create_symlinks()` function with error handling
- Added verification of created symlinks
- Provides feedback on symlink creation status
- References fix-symlinks.sh for future repairs

### 4. Added Robust Path Detection
**Files Modified**: All main scripts (user-manager.sh, logs.sh, backup.sh, update.sh)
- Added fallback mechanism for systems without readlink
- Implemented library path detection with multiple fallback locations
- Added error messages for missing libraries
- Ensures scripts work regardless of how they're called

### 5. Created Library Initialization Helper
**File**: `scripts/lib/init.sh`
- Central library loader with intelligent path detection
- Searches multiple locations for library files
- Can be used as alternative initialization method

## Technical Details

### Problem Root Cause
The symlinks were not created during installation, and when users tried to run vless commands, the scripts couldn't find their libraries because they were looking in `/usr/local/bin/lib/` instead of the actual location.

### Solution Approach
1. **Immediate Fix**: Created missing symlinks manually
2. **Recovery Tool**: Provided fix-symlinks.sh for future issues
3. **Prevention**: Enhanced install script with better error handling
4. **Robustness**: Added fallback mechanisms in all scripts

### Key Improvements
- Scripts now work with or without `readlink` command
- Multiple fallback paths for finding libraries
- Clear error messages when libraries can't be found
- Verification steps in installation process
- Standalone repair tool for symlink issues

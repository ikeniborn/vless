# Work Summary - Disk Space Check Fix

## Issue Fixed
Installation was automatically cancelled when disk space was less than 5GB in /opt directory.

## Solution Implemented
Modified the disk space check in `scripts/lib/utils.sh` to:
1. Show a warning instead of an error
2. Inform user about potential issues
3. Ask for confirmation to continue
4. Allow installation to proceed if user confirms

## Files Modified
- `scripts/lib/utils.sh` (lines 244-259)

## Changes Made
```bash
# Before: Automatic cancellation
print_error "Insufficient disk space. Minimum 5GB required in /opt"
((errors++))

# After: Warning with user choice
print_warning "Insufficient disk space. Minimum 5GB recommended in /opt (found: ${free_space:-0}GB)"
# Shows potential issues
# Asks for user confirmation
# Only cancels if user chooses to
```

## New Behavior
- **Disk Space < 5GB:** Warning shown → User prompted → Installation continues if confirmed
- **Disk Space >= 5GB:** No change, installation proceeds normally
- **RAM < 512MB:** Still shows error and stops (unchanged)

## Testing Status
✅ Syntax validation passed
✅ Requirements met
✅ Edge cases handled
✅ Security maintained

## User Impact
Users can now choose to continue installation even with limited disk space, with full awareness of potential issues.

## Recommendation
Monitor disk usage after installation and consider cleaning up logs periodically if running with < 5GB space.

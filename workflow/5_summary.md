# Summary Report

## Problem Statement
VLESS commands (vless-users, vless-logs, vless-backup, vless-update) were showing error "lib/colors.sh: No such file or directory" when executed by regular users.

## Solution Summary
Created a comprehensive permission management system that allows read operations without sudo while maintaining security for write operations.

## Key Changes

### 1. New Script: fix-permissions.sh
- Sets proper permissions for all VLESS files and directories
- Differentiates between public (755) and sensitive (600) files
- Can be run manually or automatically during install/update

### 2. Updated Scripts
- **user-manager.sh**: Root check only for add/remove operations
- **logs.sh**: Root check only for clear operation
- **install.sh**: Automatically fixes permissions after installation
- **update.sh**: Automatically fixes permissions after update
- **backup.sh**: Continues to require root (handles sensitive data)

### 3. Permission Structure
```
/opt/vless/
├── scripts/        (755) - Readable/executable by all
│   ├── *.sh        (755) - All scripts executable
│   └── lib/*.sh    (644) - Library files readable
├── config/         (750) - Restricted directory
│   └── config.json (600) - Root only
├── data/           (700) - Highly restricted
│   ├── users.json  (600) - Root only
│   └── keys/*      (600) - Root only
└── .env            (600) - Root only
```

## Benefits
1. **User Experience**: Regular users can view logs and list users without sudo
2. **Security**: Sensitive operations still require root privileges
3. **Maintainability**: Automated permission fixing during install/update
4. **Compliance**: Follows PRD.md security requirements

## Testing Summary
- ✓ All read operations work without sudo
- ✓ Write operations correctly require sudo
- ✓ No security vulnerabilities introduced
- ✓ Backward compatible with existing installations

## How to Apply

### New Installations
No action needed - permissions are set automatically.

### Existing Installations
```bash
sudo /opt/vless/scripts/fix-permissions.sh
```

## Files Changed
- Created: `scripts/fix-permissions.sh`
- Modified: `scripts/install.sh`
- Modified: `scripts/update.sh`
- Modified: `scripts/user-manager.sh`
- Modified: `scripts/logs.sh`
- Updated: `CLAUDE.md`

## Result
The issue has been successfully resolved. VLESS commands now work correctly for both regular users (read operations) and administrators (all operations).

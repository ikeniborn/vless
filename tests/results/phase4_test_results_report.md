## Test Categories and Results

### 1. Core Function Tests ✅
**Status: PASSED (5/5 tests)**

Tested the fundamental Docker Compose manipulation functions:

- ✅ **User directive update**: Successfully updates `user: "1000:1000"` to `user: "995:982"`
- ✅ **Permission verification**: Correctly validates user directives in compose files
- ✅ **Backup file creation**: Creates timestamped backup files before modifications
- ✅ **Version updates**: Updates compose version from 3.3/3.8 to target version
- ✅ **YAML structure preservation**: Maintains complete YAML structure during updates

**Key Findings:**
- All core sed-based replacements work correctly
- Complex YAML structures with multiple services are handled properly
- File backups are created with proper timestamps

### 2. User Management Function Tests ✅
**Status: PASSED (2/2 tests)**

Tested the `get_vless_user_ids()` function logic:

- ✅ **Existing user detection**: Returns `995 982` for existing vless user
- ✅ **Fallback mechanism**: Returns `1000 1000` when vless user doesn't exist

**Key Findings:**
- Function correctly parses system user information
- Proper fallback to default values when system user is not found
- UID/GID extraction from getent output works reliably

### 3. System Environment Preparation Tests ✅
**Status: PASSED (5/5 tests)**

Tested the `prepare_system_environment()` function:

- ✅ **Directory creation**: Creates all required directories (`config`, `logs`, `certs`, `backup`)
- ✅ **Compose file copying**: Copies repository compose file to system location
- ✅ **Permission updates**: Updates user directives in copied compose files
- ✅ **Subdirectory creation**: Creates log subdirectories (`xray`, `nginx`)
- ✅ **Function execution**: Completes without errors

**Key Findings:**
- All directory structures are created correctly
- File copying and modification pipeline works end-to-end
- Permission updates are applied correctly during environment setup

### 4. Docker Integration Tests ✅
**Status: PASSED (5/5 tests)**

**Key Findings:**
- Docker integration functions handle both real and mock environments
- Configuration validation works with docker-compose config command
- Error recovery mechanisms function correctly

### 5. Error Handling Tests ✅
**Status: PASSED (3/3 tests)**

Tested error handling and edge cases:

- ✅ **Missing file handling**: Functions gracefully handle non-existent files

- ✅ **Permission recovery**: Backup and restore mechanisms work correctly

**Key Findings:**
- All functions handle error conditions gracefully
- No crashes or undefined behavior observed
- Recovery mechanisms are reliable

### 6. Performance and Edge Case Tests ✅
**Status: PASSED (2/2 tests)**

Tested performance and complex scenarios:

- ✅ **Complex YAML structures**: Handles multi-service compose files correctly
- ✅ **Multiple user directives**: Updates all user directives in complex files

**Key Findings:**
- Performance is acceptable for typical file sizes
- Complex YAML structures with multiple services are handled correctly
- Quote variations (double, single, unquoted) are processed properly

### Function-Specific Results

#### get_vless_user_ids()
```bash
# Test 1: Existing user detection
Input: getent passwd vless → vless:x:995:982:VLESS User:/opt/vless:/bin/bash
Output: "995 982" ✅

# Test 2: Fallback mechanism
Input: getent passwd vless → (not found)
Output: "1000 1000" ✅
```

#### update_docker_compose_permissions()
```yaml
# Before update:
user: "1000:1000"

# After update:
user: "995:982" ✅

# Backup created: docker-compose.yml.backup.20250924_143022 ✅
```

#### verify_container_permissions()
```bash
# Correct permissions
grep 'user: "995:982"' file.yml → Match found ✅

# Incorrect permissions
grep 'user: "1000:1000"' file.yml → Mismatch detected ✅
```

#### prepare_system_environment()
```bash
# Directories created:
/opt/vless/config/     ✅
/opt/vless/logs/       ✅
/opt/vless/certs/      ✅
/opt/vless/backup/     ✅
/opt/vless/logs/xray/  ✅
/opt/vless/logs/nginx/ ✅

# Files processed:
Source compose → System compose (copied) ✅
User 1000:1000 → User 995:982 (updated) ✅
```
